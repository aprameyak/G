# GitaGPT

GitaGPT is an AI-powered chatbot that intelligently answers user queries using the teachings of the Bhagavad Gita. It integrates GPT-4 with a vectorized verse retrieval system, leveraging FAISS (Facebook AI Similarity Search) for efficient semantic search. The backend, built with FastAPI, processes user queries by retrieving the most relevant verses using sentence embeddings from SBERT (Sentence-BERT). These verses are then passed to GPT-4 via the OpenAI API, ensuring responses are both contextually accurate and spiritually insightful. The frontend, developed with Next.js, provides a seamless user experience, displaying AI-generated answers along with chapter-verse citations for further exploration.
